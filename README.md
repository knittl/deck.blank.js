deck.blank.js
=============

`deck.blank.js` is an extension for the *deck.js* presentation framework and enables users to blank the currently visible slide at the press of a button.
This mimics behavior of several other popular presentation applications.

Currently, users can make the presenation black by pressing `b` or `.`, and white by pressing `w`.
